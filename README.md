## Slamesh: Real-time Localization and Meshing for Lidar Sensors

The official implementation of SLAMesh. 

The paer is under review. The code will be open-sourced upon acceptance of the publication.

## Introduction

This work designs a **S**imultaneously **L**ocalization **A**nd **Mesh**ing system (SLAMesh). It can build, registrate, and update the mesh maps **in real-time with CPU resource**. Mesh is a kind of 3-D dense model representations with low-memory consumption. It has the capability to model complex structures and has the feasibility for rendering. We bridge localization with meshing at the same time to benefit each other. The experiments show that our SLAMesh can run at around 40 Hz. The localization and meshing accuracy also outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.
